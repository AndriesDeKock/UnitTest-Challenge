# UnitTest-Challenge

# Goal
1) Create tests for the Calculator class. Make sure to test that the proper exceptions are thrown. <b>Do not change the code in the Calculator class</b>

2) Test the TextDataAccess class but do not permit the system to write to an actual file. This means you will need to rewrite the method to be more testable. Make sure you test for the PathTooLongException. Also, ensure that the filePath gets changed to just the file name (no path).
